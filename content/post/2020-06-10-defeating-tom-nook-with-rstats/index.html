<p>I love Animal Crossing.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing">Animal Crossing</a> is a social simulation video game franchise, where you play as a <em>human</em> living in a village inhabiting by talking animals. There is really <em>no point</em> to the game other than paying off your house loans and building up your village through crafting, fishing, bug hunting, planting, etc. There are endless possibilities and you can play at <em>entirely your own pace</em>, which is why it is so appealing and inviting to many different play styles.</p>
<p>While the <em>Animal Crossing</em> franchise has been around since 2001, I finally joined the hype train with <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> for the Nintendo Switch. While the overall scope of <em>New Horizons</em> is similar to other entries in the franchise, <em>New Horizons</em> places you on a deserted island where you slowly pay off your debts to <strong>Tom Nook</strong>, the greedy capitalist raccoon who serves as the one barrier to quickly building up your island paradise.</p>
<p>In a time full of uncertainty and distress, it has been nice having a little island getaway. So naturally, I was overjoyed when I heard that an Animal Crossing dataset was added to the <strong>amazing</strong> <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">TidyTuesday repository</a>.</p>
<p>And I knew <em>right away</em> what question I wanted to answer with the data:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">my mom just asked me if it is possible to defeat tom nook</p>&mdash; hacker! üî™ (@octolinghacker) <a href="https://twitter.com/octolinghacker/status/1250245127118835712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs time to show that greedy raccoon who‚Äôs boss!</p>

<h2>Exploring the data</h2>
<p>The analysis that follows will use the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/readme.md">Animal Crossing data posted to the TidyTuesday GitHub repository</a>, which was sourced from <a href="https://github.com/jefflomacy/villagerdb">VillagerDB</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/animal-crossing-new-horizons/critic-reviews">Metacritic</a>.</p>

<p>These datasets contain a <em>ton</em> of information for any fan of <em>Animal Crossing</em>, ranging from characteristics of every item appearing in <em>New Horizons</em> to user reviews of the game (focusing on the latest edition rather than the entire franchise).</p>
<p>My goal is, quite simply, to <em>defeat Tom Nook</em>. But let‚Äôs rephrase this into a question that makes slightly more sense in the context of the data. Because Nook operates the village store and charges <em>exorbitant</em> prices for basically everything, <em>how can we quickly put Nook out of business</em>? We might have a good shot if we <em>stop buying Nook‚Äôs most highly-priced items</em>, so let‚Äôs find <strong>which items sold from Nook businesses sell for the most</strong>.</p>
<p>Using the <code>items</code> dataset, let‚Äôs first check the source of each item in the game<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>items %&gt;%
  count(sources, sort = TRUE)</code></pre>

<p>There are a lot of <code>NA</code>s, which consists primarily of <em>craftable items</em> that you create yourself by gathering resources from around your island, or <em>villager photos</em> obtainable by earning a high enough friendship level with them. Many of the items come from Nook‚Äôs Cranny (Tom Nook‚Äôs store), while a handful of items come from other Nook businesses.</p>
<p>As one small data-cleaning step before we continue, I‚Äôd like to remove <em>duplicate items</em>, which mostly appear due to multiple colors of the same item:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>items_dup &lt;- items %&gt;%
  distinct(name, .keep_all = TRUE)</code></pre>

<h2>Defeating Tom Nook</h2>
<p>First, let‚Äôs find which <em>item categories</em> Nook tends to sell for the most, on average. To do this, I‚Äôm using <code>stringr</code>‚Äôs <code>str_detect</code> to find elements of the <code>sources</code> column that contain the string <code>"Nook"</code> (rather than filtering by every Nook business one-by-one)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>items_dup %&gt;%
  filter(str_detect(sources, pattern = &quot;Nook&quot;)) %&gt;%
  group_by(category) %&gt;%
  summarize(avg_sell = mean(buy_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(category, avg_sell), y = avg_sell)) +
  geom_col(fill = &quot;tan3&quot;, color = &quot;gray89&quot;) +
  labs(
    x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;Average Sell Value (in bells)&quot;,
    title = &quot;Which items does Nook sell for the most?&quot;,
    caption = &quot;Source: TidyTuesday and VillagerDB&quot;
  ) +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 14, family = &quot;FinkHeavy&quot;),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  coord_flip()</code></pre>

<p>I think we could survive by not purchasing <em>wallpaper</em> and <em>furniture</em> from Nook; there are plenty of craftable items - just live off the land! Also, Saharah the traveling camel will visit once a week and sell better wallpaper and flooring. Not purchasing any music would be tough, but‚Ä¶perhaps worth it?</p>

<div id="truly-defeating-tom-nook" class="section level2">
<h2>(Truly) Defeating Tom Nook</h2>
<p>It isn‚Äôt enough to stop purchasing items from Nook businesses. He probably has a pretty large nest egg by now; he‚Äôs been overcharging since 2001! No, we can do so much more. So rather than <em>not</em> buying <em>Nook items</em>, what if we <em>sold items back to Nook</em> that <strong>Nook himself doesn‚Äôt sell in the first place</strong>? I‚Äôm thinking (i) craft items from resources around your island, (ii) sell these to Nook, (iii) <strong>PROFIT</strong>, (iv) rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>As before, I‚Äôll use <code>str_detect()</code>, but now I‚Äôll use it to <em>remove</em> any categories that contain the string ‚ÄúNook‚Äù (remember, we don‚Äôt want to sell Nook his own items which he already profited from selling). Let‚Äôs find which <em>item categories</em> Nook tends to buy back for the most, on average, <em>restricting to items that Nook doesn‚Äôt sell in the first place</em>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>items_dup %&gt;%
  filter(!str_detect(sources, pattern = &quot;Nook&quot;) | is.na(sources)) %&gt;%
  group_by(category) %&gt;%
  summarize(avg_buyback = mean(sell_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(category, avg_buyback), y = avg_buyback)) +
  geom_col(fill = &quot;tan3&quot;, color = &quot;gray89&quot;) +

    x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;Average Sell Value (in bells)&quot;,

<p>As I mentioned previously, there isn‚Äôt a major need to buy furniture from Nook; there is plenty of furniture that you can obtain through other means! Fortunately, Nook values this furniture quite highly, and will buy it back for an average of 5,479 bells (<em>Animal Crossing</em> currency). Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the <code>Furniture</code> category. If most of these items are craftables, which items should I focus on the most, if I want to sell for the most bells?</p>
<p>The top 4 <em>furniture items</em> in terms of <em>sell value</em> are given below. We had to omit the <code>"Robot Hero"</code> and <code>"Grand Piano"</code> items - these weren‚Äôt flagged in the data as a Nook item, but they can actually be redeemed using Nook Miles and bought from Nook‚Äôs Cranny, respectively<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>items_top4 &lt;- items_dup %&gt;%
  filter(category == &quot;Furniture&quot; &amp; !(name %in% c(&quot;Robot Hero&quot;, &quot;Grand Piano&quot;))) %&gt;%
  filter(!str_detect(sources, pattern = &quot;Nook&quot;) | is.na(sources)) %&gt;%
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, sell_value)) %&gt;%
  top_n(4, wt = sell_value)
items_top4 %&gt;%
  select(name, sell_value)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   name                   sell_value
##   &lt;fct&gt;                       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Elaborate Kimono Stand      55000
## 2 Golden Casket               80000
## 3 Golden Seat                 50000
## 4 Golden Toilet               60000</code></pre>
<p>This table consists predominately of <em>gold</em> items. Gold is a relatively rare item found around your island, so crafting items with gold are expected to net a lot of bells!</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs visualize this table with a barplot. But to take things one step further, I‚Äôll use the wonderful <code>ggpattern</code> package <a href="https://coolbutuseless.github.io/package/ggpattern/">https://coolbutuseless.github.io/package/ggpattern/</a> to embed image files in the bars. Conveniently enough, image links for each item are <em>already included in the data</em>. Thanks, TidyTuesday!</p>
<p>After a bit of wrangling to get the item image to match up with the correct item (while preserving the appropriate factor order based on <em>descending</em> <code>sell_value</code>), we can see that the <strong>golden casket</strong> is the highest-selling item not previously sold by Nook.</p>

<h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<p>What have we learned?</p>
<ul>
<li>You can accumulate plenty of furniture and other housewares without purchasing them from Tom Nook.</li>
<li>Selling furniture and fish tend to net <em>you</em> the highest profit.</li>
<li>There are <em>many</em> items that Nook does not sell which he will pay the big bells for.</li>
<li>Save your <strong>gold</strong>. You can use it to craft items that sell for a lot of bells!</li>
